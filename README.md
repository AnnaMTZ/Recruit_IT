# Recruit_IT
Software solution for a freelance recruiter


Case premise 

The client is a freelance recruiter who is looking for a software solution to enhance his workflow. He wants a custom-built portal in which he can store/add the CVs he’s collected from potential hires as well as a personal to do list on the homepage of his own tasks.    

The to do list is fully functional and lets the user add, cross off and delete tasks. The current date for the to do list is automatically filled in, using JavaScript.  

The client wants to be able to export the data he’s collected.
